### Exercise (pre-module)
- Exercise 00/01 - set-up for git, github and npm&gulp

## Standup
- How is everyone finding the bootcamp so far, what have they enjoyed learning?
- Intro to the week and the git module

## Discussion
- What sort of things have you needed to version control in the past and why

## Slides / talk 
- Coding problems we face: coding is hard, there are lots of files and often lots of people
- What is git
- Git isn't automatic, you tell it what to do
- Introduce snapshots or commits

### Demo - setup 
- [ ] Setup new project `git init`, verify it works with `git status`
- [ ] Create file `touch index.html`, `git status`
- [ ] Tell git the file exists and add it to staging `git add index.html`, `git status`
- [ ] First commit with one file, `git commit -m "Initial commit"`, `git status`
- [ ] Explain states (added, tracked, staged, committed) and how to view them
- [ ] `git status -s` - outputs the states with letters
- [ ] Next commit with two files

## Slides / talk
- Recap of state and abbreviations
- Recap key terms

- [04-info.md](../challenges/01/04-info.md)

## Slides / talk
- The importance of meaningful commit messages
- Introducing `git add` shortcuts

### Exercise
- [05-simple-project.md](../challenges/01/05-simple-project.md)

- [ ] Git only adds data
- [ ] Hidden .git folder

### Demo - the head, the master and moving between commits

- [ ] `git checkout master`
- [ ] What is master?
- [ ] `git reset --hard HEAD` and `git reset --soft HEAD`

### Exercise
[06-rewind.md](../challenges/01/06-rewind.md)

## Talk: Moving files, removing, .gitignore

- [ ] ways of moving files, why use `git mv`
- [ ] ways of removing files, why use `git mv`


### Demo - moving, deleting
- Follow the screenshots
1) apples.html using `mv`
2) oranges.html using `git mv`
3) apples.html using `rm`
4) oranges.html using `git rm`
5) git reset `git reset --hard HEAD` - deletes all non committed changes
6) git reset `git reset --soft HEAD` - preserves tracked files

### Exercises
- [07-move-files.md](../challenges/01/07-move-files.md)
- [08-remove-files.md](../challenges/01/08-remove-files.md)
