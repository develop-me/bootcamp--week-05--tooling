# [05] Tooling Week: Day 1 - Git

### Exercise (pre-module)
- Exercise 00/01 - set-up for git, github and npm&gulp

## Standup
- How is everyone finding the bootcamp so far, what have they enjoyed learning?
- Intro to the week and the git module

## Discussion
- What sort of things have you needed to version control in the past and why

## Slides / talk 
- Coding problems we face: coding is hard, there are lots of files and often lots of people
- What is git
- Git isn't automatic, you tell it what to do
- Introduce terminology: repositories and commits

### Demo - setup 
- [ ] Setup new project `git init`, verify it works with `git status`
- [ ] Create file `touch index.html`, `git status`
- [ ] Tell git the file exists and add it to staging `git add index.html`, `git status`
- [ ] First commit with one file, `git commit -m "Initial commit"`, `git status`
- [ ] Explain states (added, tracked, staged, committed) and how to view them
- [ ] `git status -s` - outputs the states with letters
- [ ] Next commit with two files

### Exercises
- [01-setup.md](../challenges/01/01-setup.md)
- [02-track-files.md](../challenges/01/02-track-files.md)
- [03-changes.md](../challenges/01/03-changes.md)

## Slides / talk
- The importance of meaningful commit messages
- Introducing `git add` shortcuts

### Demo - `git add`
- [ ] `git add .` - tracks all file including hidden ones like `.gitignore`
- [ ] `git add *` - tracks all files but not hidden ones
- [ ] talk through risk of blanket adding all your files to staging - gotta always be thinking
- [ ] `git commit -am "message"`

### Exercise
- [04-simple-project.md](../challenges/01/04-simple-project.md)
- Ask students to share their commit messages on Slack

Advanced exercises: 
- [05-move-files.md](../challenges/01/05-move-files.md)
- [06-remove-files.md](../challenges/01/06-remove-files.md)

## OPTIONAL Talk: Moving files, removing, .gitignore

This covers the content in challenges 01/05 and 01/06.

- [ ] ways of moving files, why use `git mv`
- [ ] ways of removing files, why use `git mv`

### OPTIONAL Demo - moving, deleting
- Follow the screenshots
1) apples.html using `mv`
2) oranges.html using `git mv`
3) apples.html using `rm`
4) oranges.html using `git rm`
5) git reset `git reset --hard HEAD` - deletes all non committed changes
6) git reset `git reset --soft HEAD` - preserves tracked files


## Slides / talk
- [ ] Git has integrity & checksums
- [ ] Git only adds data
- [ ] Hidden .git folder
- [ ] Best practice tips

### Demo - the head, the master and moving between commits
- [ ] `git show HEAD`
- [ ] `git reflog`
- [ ] `git checkout {ref}`
- [ ] `git show HEAD`
- [ ] `git checkout master`
- [ ] What is master?
- [ ] Removing experimental work from the commit you are working on - `git reset --hard HEAD` and `git reset --soft HEAD`

### Exercise
[07-rewind.md](../challenges/01/07-rewind.md)


## Talk: file lifesycle & staging
- [ ] role and usage of `.gitignore`

## Talk: Branches

- [ ] basic usage and visualisation

### Demo

- [ ] Master as default branch (synonymous with "production")
- [ ] Create branch
- [ ] checkout branch
- [ ] see branches
- [ ] do work
- [ ] switching branches
- [ ] merge branch
- [ ] delete branch
