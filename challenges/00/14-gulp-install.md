# Install `gulp`

## 1) Run:

```bash
npm install gulp-cli -g
npm install gulp -D
```

*Note: you may need to add `sudo` before each command if they fail due to permissions.*

## 2) Check if Gulp is installed

Run `gulp -v`

We expect something like:

```bash
CLI version: 2.2.0
Local version 3.9.1 (or might be Unknown)
```

## Do you get that?

### [Yes](15-fin.md)
