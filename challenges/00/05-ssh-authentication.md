# Level 5: Password-less use of Git


To avoid you needing to enter your GitHub username and password everytime Git interacts with GitHub.

## Check your SSH keys are in place

```bash
ssh git@github.com
```

You should get something like this with `[username]` replaced with your username:

```
Hi [username]! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

## Do you get that?

### [Yes](09-git-config.md)

### [No](06-ssh-keys.md)
