# Build a simple site

This exercise is to help you practice using Git and to get you used to thinking about how to divide your work into sensible commits. **Read through the instructions at least once before you start work** - this will help you plan sensible chunks of work that will form your commits.

- start a new project (new folder, new Git repo)
- create 3 HTML pages (home, about and contact) each with normal HTML boilerplate: `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>`.
- add at least HTML 4 elements to each page `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`
- create a `css` folder with stylesheet
- create a `img` folder with image(s)
- populate with some dummy content eg images

At appropriate points use `git add` and `git commit` to create a snapshot of your progress so far. This may be after creating each page, or when completing each element, this is up to you. Ensure you commit names are meaningful.

- At the end you should aim to have done **at least** 8 commits (use `git log` to see your commits so far)
- Aim for clear, informative commit messages.

*Note: Don't worry about making your web pages perfect, the purpose is to practice using Git.*

### After you have finished
- Emoji the task on Slack so the instructor knows you have finished.
- Share a summary of your commit messages on Slack.

### Stretch challenges
- if you have time add some CSS styling
- experiment with the -a flag in git commit -am (in the notes PDF box on "git commit arguments")
